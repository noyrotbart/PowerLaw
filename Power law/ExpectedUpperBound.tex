\subsection{A labeling scheme for random graphs}
There are schemes using randomness to ``grow''  graphs that, with high probability, have approximate power-law degree distribution for a range of degrees. One such scheme is the preferential attachment model \cite{barabasi1999emergence}. For graphs obtained from such models, their degree sequences are instead probability distributions. We now show that applying our labeling scheme for $\PLB$ to random graphs with the power law distribution results in a small expected worst-case label size.

Using the definition of Mitzenmacher \cite{mitzenmacher2004brief}, a random variable $X$ is said to have the \emph{power law} distribution (w.r.t.~$\alpha > 1$) if
\[
  Pr[X\geq x] \sim cx^{-\alpha+1},
\]
for a constant $c > 0$, i.e., $\lim_{x\to\infty}Pr[X\geq x]/cx^{-\alpha+1} = 1$.

Let $\epsilon > 0$ be fixed. Consider a graph $G$ picked from a family $\mathcal F$ of random graphs whose degree sequences have the power law distribution. Order the vertices of $G$ arbitrarily as $v_1,\ldots,v_n$. For $i=1,\ldots,n$, let indicator variable $X_i$ be $1$ iff $v_i$ has degree at least $d = \sqrt[\alpha]{n/\log n}$. There is a constant $N_0\in\mathbb N$ (depending on $\epsilon$) such that if $n\geq N_0$ then for all $i$,
\[
  E[X_i] = \mbox{Pr}[X_i = 1]\leq (1+\epsilon)cd^{-\alpha+1}.
\]

With the same labeling scheme as for $\PLB$ with degree threshold $d$, denote by $E_n$ the expected label size of an $n$-vertex graph from $\mathcal F$. Then for all $n\geq N_0$,
\begin{align*}
  E_n & = \sum_{x=0}^n \mbox{Pr}\left[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i = x\right]O((x+d\log n))\\
                       & = O\left(d\log n + E\left[\sum_{i=1}^n X_i\right]\right)\\
                       & = O\left(d\log n + \sum_{i=1}^n E[X_i]\right)\\
                       & = O\left(d\log n + nd^{-\alpha+1}\right)\\
                       & = O\left(\sqrt[\alpha]n(\log n)^{1-1/\alpha}\right).
\end{align*}
\begin{theorem}\label{th:random}
Let $\mathcal F$ be a family of graphs with degree sequences having the power law distribution w.r.t.~$\alpha > 1$. Then there is a labeling scheme for $\mathcal F$ such that the expected worst-case label size of any graph $G\in\mathcal F$ is $O(\sqrt[\alpha]n(\log n)^{1-1/\alpha})$ where $n$ is the number of vertices of $G$.
\end{theorem}
