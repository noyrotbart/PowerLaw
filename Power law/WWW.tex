% THIS IS SIGPROC-SP.TEX - VERSION 3.1
% WORKS WITH V3.2SP OF ACM_PROC_ARTICLE-SP.CLS
% APRIL 2009
%
% It is an example file showing how to use the 'acm_proc_article-sp.cls' V3.2SP
% LaTeX2e document class file for Conference Proceedings submissions.
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V3.2SP) *DOES NOT* produce:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) Page numbering
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% It is an example which *does* use the .bib file (from which the .bbl file
% is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission,
% you need to 'insert'  your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

\title{Peer-to-Peer Power-Law Graphs}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{1} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\begin{abstract}
The study of web graph compression assumes a centralised data structure which is undesired in peer-to-peer networks.
We propose an investigation on web graph dissemination using a theoretically appropriate method, adjacency labeling scheme. These are  methods that assigns labels to the vertices of a graph such that adjacency between them 
can be inferred directly from the assigned labels, without using a  centralized data structure.
We first provide a lower bound for the family of power-law graphs. 
% This  family has been used to model many types of networks, e.g. the Internet AS-level graph. 
Furthermore, we  provide an almost matching  upper bound for this family.
%We also provide an asymptotically near-optimal  labeling scheme for sparse graphs.
This upper bound is attained by pre-determining a threshold separating nodes of large degree and small degree that attempts to balance the storage required among the vertices. 
We use this technique further and produce a distance labeling scheme for the family.
Finally, we validate the usefulness of the label and the efficiency of our separation by  an experimental evaluation  using both synthetic data and real-world networks of small to medium scale.
