\begin{abstract}
A vast majority of  the underlying graphs of social and web networks  have been shown to be power-law graphs.
Storing  power-law graphs in turn, has become   fundamental and  well studied topic.
Due to their size, such graphs are not only compressed, but distributed across several computers.

We study the storage of  power-law graphs in a completely distributed manner, using  \emph{adjacency labeling scheme}.
This theoretical tool assigns  labels to the vertices of a graph, such that   adjacency between two vertices can be inferred using only the information of their corresponding labels. By that, there is no need for a centralized data structure to hold the graph, and adjacency queries are resolved between two vertices locally. The quality of a labeling scheme is determined by the size of the largest label size it produces, so that each vertex is guaranteed to need at most that number of bits for that purpose.

Given the number of vertices of high degree is low in such networks, a natural idea is to store the adjacency relation between low and high degree vertices the only in the vertices of  low degree. 
We show that, using  a careful selection of the \emph{threshold} between vertices of high and low degree, this strategy alone produces not only good labeling schemes in practice, but that it is theoretically almost optimal. 
The examination of the labeling scheme in practice is done by an experimental evaluation using both synthetic data and real-world networks.
The theoretical proof is done by showing near matching upper and lower bounds, both for deterministically and probabilistically  constructed power-law graphs.
Finally, we use the  technique  to produce a  theoretically interesting distance labeling scheme for the family.
